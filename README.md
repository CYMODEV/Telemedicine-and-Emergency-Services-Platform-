‚Ä¢ Immediate Safety: One‚Äëtap emergency escalation when harmful frequency exposure is detected.
‚Ä¢ Holistic Care: Access to general medicine, counseling, psychiatry, homeopathic and natural medicine.
‚Ä¢ Empowerment: Structured reflection tools to log feelings, encounters, and symptoms for both personal recovery and compliance records.


For Practitioners

‚Ä¢ Integrated Workflows: Telemedicine sessions, secure Rx drafting, and compliance‚Äëready documentation.
‚Ä¢ Expanded Reach: Ability to serve patients across geographies with regulatory alignment.
‚Ä¢ Trust & Transparency: Immutable audit trails and consent‚Äëfirst data handling.


For Regulators & Legal Stakeholders

‚Ä¢ Evidence‚ÄëGrade Reporting: Automated incident logs with frequency data, timestamps, and user reflections.
‚Ä¢ Compliance Tools: Spectrum monitoring dashboards and stakeholder registries.
‚Ä¢ Multi‚ÄëAudience Coordination: Shared incident lifecycle across regulators, practitioners, pharmacies, and legal support.


For Enterprises & Partners

‚Ä¢ Risk Mitigation: Protects staff and infrastructure from frequency interference.
‚Ä¢ Regulatory Alignment: Ensures compliance with FCC, ITU, HIPAA, and GDPR.
‚Ä¢ Strategic Differentiation: First‚Äëmover advantage in a new category blending safety, health, and compliance.

Investment Requirements

Seed Round Target

‚Ä¢ Raise: $1.5M ‚Äì $5M
‚Ä¢ Use of Funds:‚Ä¢ Finalize MVP commercialization of aggregator and feedback platform.
‚Ä¢ Deliver catalog, consent engine and partner pilots.
‚Ä¢ Establish a new service class‚ÄîBiological Energy Therapeutic Service (BETS)‚Äîunder telecom regulators, modeled on MedRadio/MICS band governance A.
‚Ä¢ Form an interdisciplinary steering committee with the FCC (or ITU regional body), FDA (or equivalent), biofield researchers, engineers, and practitioner representatives.
‚Ä¢ Publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) defining BETS scope: permissible uses (intent-driven energy healing, PEMF adjuncts), frequency ranges, and code-division rules.
‚Ä¢ Solicit public comments and revise draft regulations in two iterative cycles before finalizing the service rules.

Device Certification & Safety Compliance
Classify BETS devices as FDA Class II medical devices (510(k) pathway) requiring:1. Electrical safety and EMC testing
2. SAR or biofield-exposure assessment (drawing on PEMF safety standards B)
3. Clinical validation supporting device-specific protocols

‚Ä¢ Mandate device labeling: frequency ranges, maximum power, code-set identifiers, manufacturer registration.
‚Ä¢ Authorize accredited test labs for emission verification, code-orthogonality checks, and user-interface safety audits.
Practitioner Licensing & Oversight
Launch a BETS Practitioner Registry: credential biofield healers who:‚Ä¢ Complete spectrum-use training and pass an exam on BETS technical/safety rules.
‚Ä¢ Demonstrate competency in device operation and session protocols.

‚Ä¢ Issue spectrum-use licenses tied to practitioner IDs and code blocks.
‚Ä¢ Deploy spectrum-monitoring sensors to detect unauthorized or out-of-band emissions, triggering audit or enforcement actions.
Clinical Protocols & Evidence Generation

‚Ä¢ Define Standardized Healing Protocols:‚Ä¢ Session duration, code-sequence selection, modulation parameters mapped to healing modalities (e.g., Reiki, PEMF).
‚Ä¢ Pre- and post-session clinical-outcome metrics (stress, pain scales, sleep quality).

‚Ä¢ Partner with academic medical centers for pilot studies measuring resonance proof via calibrated infrasound sensors and patient biomarkers.
‚Ä¢ Incorporate real-world data submission: anonymized session logs, code usage, patient feedback to a central Research Repository.

Series A (Projected 18‚Äì24 months)

‚Ä¢ Raise: $6M ‚Äì $10M
‚Ä¢ Use of Funds:‚Ä¢ Scale global commercialization.
‚Ä¢ Expand enterprise features and multi‚Äëregion compliance.
‚Ä¢ Broaden partner adoption across healthcare, telecom, and regulatory agencies.

---

Strategic Advantage

‚Ä¢ Defensible IP: Integration of frequency detection with telemedicine workflows, dual logging of technical and human evidence, and symbolic onboarding rituals.
‚Ä¢ Regulatory Moat: Compliance‚Äëready infrastructure aligned with multiple jurisdictions.
‚Ä¢ Network Effects: More stakeholders onboard ‚Üí stronger data, compliance, and trust ecosystem.
